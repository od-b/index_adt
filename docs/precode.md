# Precode: Thoughts, Issues, Changes, Notes

<!-- ## Thoughts:
  * treeset.c and aatreeset.c being merged set/list implementations greatly limits the possibilites
  of using several different type sets within one file.  
    If set.h was renamed treeset.h, it would allow for a different mapset.c (etc) to exist within the same namespace.
    The drawback of such a change would be reducing the abstraction level of the interface, however,
    is this abstraction level more important than finding a suitable set implementation for the task?Â¨ -->

# Changes:
All commited changes to the precode.
This list does not including makefile changes, or additions to common.c/h.

### General modifications that do not affect logic:  
  * Removed spaces between declaration and parameters for functions and defines that takes in parameters  
  * Added brackets to many loops and if-statements where i believe it makes the code more readable  
  * Updated several inaccurate descriptions. E.g.; list_create.h, 
  * Renamed linkedlist.c to doublylinkedlist.c for clarity

### Misc:
  * updated ERROR_PRINT && DEBUG_PRINT to include line number with message. Can be turned off by not defining LINE_PRINT.

### Logical or variable type changes / additions

  * Added 'set_put()' and 'set_get()' to set.h.
    These changes are done to allow sets of structs on a more abstract basis.
    Notes, examples and detailed reasoning below.
    Prior to development, a decision had to be made. Either alter set_contains & set_add, or expand the header. While there is an alternative three - use sets 
    Neither option is particularly attractive, however - it is the authors belief that addition is the least intrusive alternative.
  
    * set_put():
      Add an element. If succesful, returns value will be the given elem.
      If elem is a duplicate, returns the duplicate elem.
      Note: ideally, set_add() could simply be altered to prove a return value.

    * set_get()
      Get an existing element from the set.
      Returns NULL if set does not contain the element.

    **The existing sets within the precode, aatreeset.c and treeset.c, have been updated to accomodate for this change.**

    **Definitions**
      * 'tree' := 'binary search tree data structure'
      * 'list' := 'linked list data structure'

    **When adding an item to a set ADT, the following operations must in some way be performed:**
      1) __check if set already contains the item, through cmpfunc__
      2) __add item if step 1 confirms item does not exist in set__

    **Context**:
      A binary search tree is inheritly an ordered set, and this makes it an excellent structure for a set ADT.
      When attempting to add an item to a tree, the tree will have to traverse to the node where the item is to be added, and abort the  process of creating a new node if an equal item already exists. 
      This process simultaneously performs operations 1) and 2), defined above. This effectively eliminates the need to manually check 'tree_contains()' prior to adding an item, seeing as the logic within 'tree_contains()' and 'tree_add()' are logically identical, apart from 'tree_add()' potentially inserting a new node at the position.

    **Demonstrating why 'set_add()' not including any return value is problematic:**
      Say we have an arbitraty struct defined as 'A' containing two pointers, 'a' and 'b'. a holds a single pointer, b holds many pointers.
      We also have a tree-based set defined as 'S', containing nodes with pointers to A as their item/data/value. S uses a cmpfunc that compares its elements according to *A->a.

      We recieve item 'x' and 'y'. We want to store pointer to x and y within an A, so that A->a = x. We create A, set A->a = x, then add it to the tree. 
      At this point, we could check whether x was a duplicate item or not by getting the set size. However, we also want to add y to A->b.
      **If x already existed within the tree, we literally no way of accessing A->b at this point, unless it is stored in an additional structure. In my personal opinion, this seems like a flaw with the set.h ADT.**

      Put short - in it's current state, the direct access functionality of set.h is limited to boolean return values.
      While there could be reasons for this on a general basis - the precode we are provided do not provide any. 
      Whether using a list, array, map or tree for the set structure - such a feature could easily be implemented.
    
      **Solution**
        * 'set_add(A)' returns:
          1) a void pointer to the elem in the tree. This can be either the elem which was given, or the existing elem, if duplicate.
          2) NULL on failure; i.e., out of memory
        * introduce 'set_get(A)', which returns:
          1) a void pointer to the elem in the tree. This can be either the elem which was given, or the existing elem, if duplicate.
          2) NULL on failure; i.e., out of memory

      We can now create a temp A, append x to A->a, and depending on set_add(A) response - we can either free the the temp A, or keep the newly created A as a node's item, within the set. Since we get the original A in return if there is one, we can access A->b from there. Thus, an easy way of storing structs in sets, without any changes to the existing code/precode.

      Seeing as 'set_add()' is a void call, this change does not affect any existing calls or functionality to set_add() within the existing precode. Simultaneously, it provides optional, and crucial information when needed.
